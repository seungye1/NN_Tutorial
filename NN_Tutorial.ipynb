    "A neural network is a computational model created from the basis of biologicial neural networks. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are able to somewhat mimic the procedures that our biological neural networks go through when recieving, processing, and transmitting information from neuron to neuron. A *neuron* in our ANN will be a part of a layer: input, hidden, or output, as shown in the diagram below. They will hold a weights that get updated using gradient descent. The neuron will recieve information, multiply the information by the weights it holds, and then transmit that information to the next layer. The end-goal of an ANN is to learn weights  that minimize error on our training data. Neural networks are highly useful for complex problems such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing."

    "The input layer takes in the information that is fed in by the user. Every neuron in the input layer represents an independent variable that influences the output of our neural network. The information from our input layer will be transferred into the hidden layer. The hidden layer is consisted of neurons that have activation functions applied to it, and holds *hidden* information that is useful to getting our output value. The hidden layer is in between the input and output layer, and its job is to process the information that is fed in by the input layer. This layer is responsible for extracting the important and required features from our input data in order to get the correct output value. Most problems in machine learning can be solved with just two hidden layers.The output layer of the ANN collects all the information held by the hidden layer and transmits the information out of the model. \n",

There are several options for the loss function in `torch.nn`, such as log-likelihood, cross-entropy loss, and negative log-likelihood loss. In our case, we are going to use the [Mean Squared Error loss function](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.MSELoss), which calculates the mean squared error between our predicted and observed y values.\n",

This means that we are going to update the weights for every batch, unlike gradient descent, where we update the weights for every epoch or full round of forward propagation. For the optimization algorithm, we will have to set the parameters to optimize as our model's parameters (`wine_model.parameters()`) and set the learning rate as 0.1. This is the step size that our algorithm takes to gradually improve our model. Here is the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, where $\\theta$ are the parameters we want to optimize over, and $\\delta$ is the learning rate. \n",

As we iterate through the batches and epochs, we will get inputs (predictor variable data) and outputs (quality), and we will wrap them in a Variable class. Then we will feed the model with our input variables to get an output, and calculate the loss using our MSE loss function. To update the weights, we will follow these steps:\n",
